I would like to preface this by saying that you should not voluntarily attempt what I did at CCO if you are serious about your results. My strategy was mainly damage control from day 1, and it was a miracle I even got silver. However, you may find my first CCO experience interesting or maybe even hilarious, which is why I am making this post. Anyways, please enjoy. ðŸ™‚

## Day 1

### P1. Swap Swap Sort

The first fault in my approach at CCO. I had some initial ideas early on, scoring the first 2 subtasks at around 16 minutes. Over the next hour, I delevoped a solution which runs in square root log time, believing it would pass with ease due to a fatal misreading of the constraints. The solution worked well for the first three subtasks, but for some reason I couldn't figure out kept receiving a `WA` verdict on the last batch. For around another hour, I read over my code countless times and ran multiple fast-slow scripts, but simply couldn't find out where the error lied. After a gruesome 2 hour and 30 minutes on problem 1, I decided to take a peek at the rest of the problemset before it was too late (although it was already way too much time wasted).

### P3. Through Another Maze Darkly

I had a quick glance over problem 2, but decided that the subtasks from problem 3 were a lot more approachable. Really, my goal here was to snatch whatever I can and rush back to problem 1 where I had the most potential points yet to be earned. A quick program that printed the path given by a random line graph revealed the pattern of $$ 1-x-1-y-1-...-1-N-1-N-... $$, for which the first idea that came to mind was binary search. This was the smoothest subtask of day 1 for me, taking only around 20 minutes of time in total.
