I would like to preface this by saying that you should not voluntarily attempt what I did at CCO if you are serious about your results. My strategy was mainly damage control from day 1, and it was a miracle I even got silver. However, you may find my first CCO experience interesting or maybe even hilarious, which is why I am making this post. Anyways, please enjoy. ðŸ™‚

The first fault in my approach at CCO. I had some initial ideas early on, scoring the first 2 subtasks at around 16 minutes.
