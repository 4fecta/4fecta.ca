mother.

    "Look at, Mother. Auntie sent you nice little cake"
    "Where is it?" his mother asked
    "Here ini my hands" He replied, and opened his hands to show her the cake.
    "Oh, Alex, you're foolish boy, "she cried
    "You've ruined it. You shouldn't carry a cake like that you 
     should wrap it carefully in some leaves  and carry it onyour head"
    "I'm sorry,Mother," said the little boy sadly."But I'll remember next time,"
     he promised.
