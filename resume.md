I love participating and organizing communities. Together with some
friends I founded the [Banyuwangi Developer](https://banyuwangidev.org/).

Iâ€™m pragmatic yet curious. I love what is simple, obvious, consistent. I
am passionate about my work. I choose the right idea over my own. I
work well in teams and can take responsibilities. Fun to work with.
