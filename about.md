Hey, this is Edward. Senior at the University of Toronto Schools and incoming freshman to Carnegie Mellon University. I don't think my English vocabulary is large enough to describe my passion for mathematics and programming. Whether it's the feeling of finally working out the key steps to a complex mathematical proof, or designing the various intricacies of sophisticated algorithms, I simply can't get enough of it. You can check out some of my profiles on various websites, such as [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/user/4fecta) or [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/4fecta). I also enjoy crafting up various problems and challenges in both math and programming, and I truly hope my creations are able to inspire some fun and challenging thinking for whoever they may entertain. A lot of my algorithmic creations are hosted on DMOJ, and I will share any miscellaneous problems in my blog.

Outside of doing nerdy things, I also enjoy watching anime and playing rhythm games (specifically プロジェクトセカイ カラフルステージ！ feat. 初音ミク). I've been working on learning the Japanese language and am now able to read light novels at a snail's pace (maybe that's nerdy too, but it should be known that the best plot of many series are hidden behind untranslated pages of Japanese text 😛). Chess is a fun game too. My music taste has been completely dominated by [ZUTOMAYO](https://youtu.be/Atvsg_zogxo), so there's that I guess.

Man I love writing About pages.
