Hey, this is Edward. Freshman at Carnegie Mellon University. I think my main personality traits are split between being a computer science enthusiast and liking Konosuba. You can check out some of my profiles on various websites, such as [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/user/4fecta) or [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/4fecta). I've been creating many competitive programming problems on DMOJ as a member of the DMOPC committee recently, and I'd love if you are interested in trying some of them out! Here's one of my personal favourites: [Ace of Diamonds](https://dmoj.ca/problem/dmopc21c9p4).

Outside of doing nerdy things, I also enjoy watching anime and playing rhythm games (specifically プロジェクトセカイ カラフルステージ！ feat. 初音ミク). I've been learning Japanese for the past 2 years now, and it's introduced me to the lovely feeling of making progress and getting nowhere at the same time. During my off-time, I enjoy  ~~getting destroyed in~~ playing chess and Mahjong with my friends (eyeballing the Riichi Mahjong course at CMU). I've also picked up ping pong again after meeting some cool (and really strong) people to play with at CMU. My music taste was completely dominated by [ZUTOMAYO](https://youtu.be/Atvsg_zogxo) for a solid year and a half, but now I'm starting to explore other J-pop and Vocaloid artists as well.

Feel free to hit me up on Discord at `4fecta#4821` and let's chat!
