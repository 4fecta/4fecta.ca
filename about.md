Hey, this is Edward. Incoming freshman to Carnegie Mellon University. I think my main personality trait is being a math and computer science enthusiast. You can check out some of my profiles on various websites, such as [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/user/4fecta) or [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/4fecta). I've been creating many competitive programming problems on DMOJ as a member of the DMOPC committee recently, and I'd love if you could try some of them out! Here's one of my personal favourites: [Ace of Diamonds](https://dmoj.ca/problem/dmopc21c9p4).

Outside of doing nerdy things, I also enjoy watching anime and playing rhythm games (specifically プロジェクトセカイ カラフルステージ！ feat. 初音ミク). I've been learning Japanese for the past 2 years now, and it's introduced me to the lovely feeling of making progress and getting nowhere at the same time. During my off-time, I enjoy  ~~getting destroyed in~~ playing chess and Mahjong with my friends (eyeballing the Riichi Mahjong course at CMU). My music taste was completely dominated by [ZUTOMAYO](https://youtu.be/Atvsg_zogxo) for a solid year and a half, but now I'm starting to explore other J-pop and Vocaloid artists as well.

Feel free to hit me up on Discord at `4fecta#4821` and let's chat!
